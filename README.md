# Marmalappic

<b>Project Description:</b><br>
This web application allows for a competition between groups of people to earn the most jars of marmalade. This competition has people go around and take a picture at unique locations around campus. The spot of the day will appear on the homepage and competitors will have to race to find the location around campus and take a picture. Users will be able to vote for the pictures they like the best, filling up the picture taker's jar of marmalade. The team with the most marmalade after the week end's will earn the Goblet o' Marmalade and gift cards to restaurants in Downtown Blacksburg.
